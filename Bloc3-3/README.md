[Presentation video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/hTT3RwX7n8M22TDi1hCyx8?)

### Introduction

Uber is a company founded in 2009, initially to provide ridesharing services. Since then, Uber expanded its activities to delivery (food, packages, couriers), freight transport and alternative means of urban transportation (bikes, scooters). Uber operates in about 70 countries and 10.500 cities and generates an average of 23 million trips per day.

### Problematic

Uber experiences ride cancellations because drivers are not always in close proximity with users.

The company would like to recommend hot-zones to their drivers.

### Scope

Uber aims at creating an application that would recommend hot-zones to their drivers at any given time of the day. The uber team already has data about pickups in major cities. They would like to test this new feature by focusing on New York City.

### Aim and objectives

Overall aim: Identify pickup hot-zones in New York City.

Objectives:
- 1 - Find hot-zones (compare two unsupervised algorithms).
- 2 - Visualize results on a dashboard.
