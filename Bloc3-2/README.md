# Bloc 3 - Analyse prédictive de données structurées par l'intelligence artificielle - Conversion rate challenge

[Presentation video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/hTT3RwX7n8M22TDi1hCyx8?)

### Introduction

www.datascienceweekly.org is a free newsletter helping people keeping up with the latest developments in data science. It is curated by independent data scientists and anyone can simply register on the website with an email address to receive weekly news.

### Problematic

wwww.datascienceweekly.org aims at improving the newsletter's conversion rate.

The creators of the newsletter would like to better understand the behavior of the users visiting their website. 

### Scope

To improve the number of subscribers to their newsletter, the creators of the newsletter designed a competion to get the best predictive model for conversion (using f1-score for rankings). They open-sourced a dataset containing information about the traffic on their website.

Competitors were asked to develop the best model for prediction and to analyse the parameters of their model to identify features that would explain the users behavior in respect to conversion.

### Aim and objectives

Overall aim: Build a machine learning model able to estimate the conversion rate and identify levers of action.

Objectives:
- 1 - Make an EDA and preprocess data for machine learning.
- 2 - Train a logistic regression model (baseline) and assess its performance.
- 3 - Improve the model's f1-score
- 4 - Make predictions on the unlabelled test set
- 5 - Make recommendations to improve the conversion rate
