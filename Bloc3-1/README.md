# Bloc 3 - Analyse prédictive de données structurées par l'intelligence artificielle - Walmart sales

### Introduction

Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation founded in 1962. As of 2022, Walmart had over 10.000 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. In 2022, Walmart was rated the world's largest company by revenue, and the world's largest private employer.

### Problematic

Walmart aims at planning and improving its future marketing campaigns.

The company would like to better understand how the sales are influenced by economic indicators.

### Scope

To predict the amount of sales from economic indicators, Walmart provided a dataset containing information about weekly sales for different Walmart stores, as well as other variables such as the unemployment rate or the fuel price.

### Aim and objectives

Overall aim: Build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in Walmart stores.

Objectives:
- 1 - Make an EDA and preprocess data for machine learning.
- 2 - Train a linear regression model (baseline) and assess its performance.
- 3 - Identify features that are important for the prediction.
- 4 - Avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model.
- 5 - Fine-tune the regularized regression model.
